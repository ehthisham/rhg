This is not a proper translation of the Japanese Ruby Hacker's Guide. For a 
real, if incomplete translation, see this:

[The Integrated Ruby Hacker's Guide](http://edwinmeyer.com/Integrated_RHG.html)

This repo will contain my own feeble attempt to translate the machine 
translated chapters. None of the other projects for translating this remarkable
book seem to be active any more, so I'll just go ahead and try myself. :)

Dsiclaimer: Japanese isn't a language I understand in the slightest. Nor is 
English my first language. The best we can hope for is a (sightly) improved 
version of the machine translated chapters. :)
